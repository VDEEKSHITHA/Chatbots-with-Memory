# Chatbots with Memory

## Overview
This project implements **chatbots with memory** using **LangChain** and **OpenAI's APIs**. The chatbot can recall previous interactions, making conversations more context-aware and engaging.

## Features
- **Conversational Memory:** Stores and retrieves past user messages.
- **LangChain Integration:** Uses LangChain's `ChatMessageHistory` to maintain chat history.
- **Multiple Chat Implementations:** Supports terminal-based chatbots and advanced context-aware responses.
- **OpenAI API Support:** Leverages OpenAI's language models to generate human-like responses.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Required Python libraries

### Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install openai langchain
```

## Usage
1. **Run the chatbot script**:
   ```sh
   python chatbots_using_memory.py
   ```
2. The chatbot will **remember past interactions** and generate responses accordingly.

## Example Interaction
```
User: What is the capital of France?
Chatbot: The capital of France is Paris.

User: And what about Germany?
Chatbot: The capital of Germany is Berlin.

User: What was my first question?
Chatbot: You asked, "What is the capital of France?"
```

## Technologies Used
- **LangChain** for conversation memory management
- **OpenAI GPT models** for natural language responses
- **Python** for scripting and logic

## Future Enhancements
- Support for **multi-session memory** across different users
- Integration with **database storage** for long-term memory
- UI-based chatbot interface
